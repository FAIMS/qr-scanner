# About this module:
This module was created for the internal purposes of the FAIMS Project to demonstrate the ability to read QR code. This module is very simple one, containing the minimal working example of the QR code scanner.

## More info: 
* The feature was developed specifically for CSIRO 2017 module and it scan QR code and Barcode in the field, previously printed by the portable Zebra P4 printer.
* This feature can be implemented into individual modules on request.
* A barcode reader has to be installed on the device in order for FAIMS Mobile to work properly. We recommend downloading apps from Google Play such as ‘Barcode Scanner’ from ZXing Team (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.zxing.client.android&hl=en).
